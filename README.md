# Afrobeats_Analysis
I analyzed Afrobeats music performance across Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music using SQL, Google Sheets, and Looker Studio.
## Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of Afrobeats songs across Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music using SQL, Google Sheets, and Looker Studio. The analysis provides insights into:

✅ Most Streamed Songs & Artists

✅ Revenue Calculation for Spotify & YouTube

✅ Top Growing Songs on YouTube

✅ Most Charted Songs Across Platforms

✅ Comparison of Artist Rankings on Different Platforms

📍 Final Deliverable: A Looker Studio Dashboard presenting key insights from the analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used

✔ SQL (BigQuery) → Data Cleaning & Querying

✔ Google Sheets → Dataset Organization

✔ Looker Studio → Interactive Reports & Visualizations

✔ Python → (Optional for further analysis)

✔ Instant Data Scraper → Web scraping tool for extracting real-time data from streaming platforms

## Data Collection Process

To gather streaming data, we used Instant Data Scraper, a browser extension that automates data extraction from web pages. The steps followed:

1️⃣ Navigate to the Official Charts: Open the respective pages for Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube charts.

2️⃣ Configure Instant Data Scraper: Set up scraping parameters to extract relevant song, artist, and ranking data.

3️⃣ Export Data to CSV: Save extracted data for further processing in SQL and Google Sheets.

4️⃣ Load into Google Sheets: Clean and organize data before running SQL queries in BigQuery.

This method ensured I had real-time, structured data for analysis without manual data entry errors.

## Challenges Faced

1️⃣ Data Merging Issues: Initially attempted to merge all query results into a single Google Sheets file, but this led to misalignment issues where different query results appeared under the wrong columns.

2️⃣ Finding a Better Approach: Instead of merging, I decided to keep each query result as a separate sheet and use Looker Studio to build individual reports for each insight.

3️⃣ Query Optimization: Some SQL queries required refining to handle NULL values and ensure accurate revenue calculations.

4️⃣ Looker Studio Setup: Setting up correct visualization types for different metrics and ensuring interactive filters worked properly.

5️⃣ Scraping Limitations: Using Instant Data Scraper required continuous monitoring to ensure extracted data was structured correctly and did not miss essential details.
